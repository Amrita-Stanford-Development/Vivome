      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        Vivome is an open, evolving platform designed to integrate three major single-cell data modalities – 
        transcriptomics (scRNA-seq), proteomics, and chromatin accessibility (scATAC-seq) – into a single, unified 
        coordinate system. By anchoring everything to a rich RNA reference, Vivome allows seamless projection of 
        unpaired datasets, enabling researchers to explore cellular identity from multiple biological angles without 
        requiring matched multi-omic experiments.
      </p>

      <h2>Why It Matters</h2>
      <p>
        Each single-cell modality captures only part of a cell’s story. RNA tells us what genes are expressed, 
        proteomics reveals the proteins actually present, and ATAC-seq shows how the genome is accessible. 
        Vivome bridges these views, aligning them so that researchers can uncover patterns, validate discoveries, 
        and transfer cell type labels across datasets with minimal or even zero prior annotation.

      <h2>What Makes Vivome Unique</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Fully Single-Cell Resolution:</strong> Every point represents a real single cell across RNA, protein, or chromatin data.</li>
        <li><strong>Unpaired Data Integration:</strong> Aligns datasets without requiring the same cells to be measured across modalities.</li>
        <li><strong>Cross-Modality Coupling:</strong> Ensures proteomic and ATAC data are aligned to each other, not just to RNA.</li>
        <li><strong>Open and Versioned:</strong> Provides pretrained encoders and reference embeddings so the atlas grows with new data.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

      <h2>Intended Impact</h2>
      <p>
        Vivome will enable scientists worldwide to project their own single-cell datasets into a shared atlas, 
        instantly contextualizing them with rich multi-omic reference data. By removing barriers to cross-modality 
        analysis, this platform will accelerate biological discoveries in immunology, systems biology, and beyond.
